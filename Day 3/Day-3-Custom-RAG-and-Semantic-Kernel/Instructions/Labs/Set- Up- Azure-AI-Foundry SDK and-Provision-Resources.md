      - Deployment Name: **gpt-4o**
      - Deployment type: **Global Standard**
      - Change the **Model version to 2024-08-06 (Default)**
      - Change the Tokens per Minute Rate Limit to **200K**
      - Click on **Deploy (5)**

1. Navigate back to **Azure Portal** and search for **AI Search** and select **AI Search** resource.


1. On the **AI Foundry | AI Search** page, select **+ Create** to create Azure OpenAI resource.


1. On **Create Azure OpenAI** page, provide the following settings and select **Next (6)**:

      | Setting | Value | 
      | --- | --- |
      | Subscription | Keep the default subscription |
      | Resource group | **AgenticAI** |
      | Region | **East US 2** |
      | Name | +++aisearch@lab.LabInstance.Id+++ |
      | Pricing tier | **Standard S0** |


1. Select **Review + create**, then **Create**

1. Back on the Azure AI Foundry tab, Select **Management Center**.

1. Under your Project select **Connected resources**.  Then select **+New connection**.  Select **Azure AI Search**, then choose **Add connection** then **Close**.

1. Next, select **Connected resources** below your Foundry hub. Then select **+New connection**.  Select **Azure AI Search**, then choose **Add connection** then **Close**.




### Task 1: Install the requirements for the Project

In this task, you will clone the GitHub repository for the project to access the necessary files for building the chat app.

1. On your **Lab VM**, launch **Visual Studio Code**.

1. Click on **File (1)**, then **Open Folder**.

1. Navigate to `C:\LabFiles\Day-3-Custom-RAG-and-Semantic-Kernel` **(1)**, select the **Custom-RAG-App (2)** folder and then click on **Select folder (3)**.

1. Click on **Yes, I trust the author**.

      >**Note:** Wait for the installation to complete. It might take some time.


### Task 2: Configure Environment Variables

In this task, you will set up and configure the necessary environment variables to ensure seamless integration between your RAG application and Azure AI Foundry services.

1. Open a new tab in the browser and navigate to Azure AI Foundry portal using below link

    ```
    https://ai.azure.com/
    ```

1. Click on the **Azure AI Foundry** Icon on top left.
1. Select your AI foundry project.
1. Navigate to your **Overview (1)** page of **ai-foundry-project-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"></inject>** and then copy and paste the **Project connection string (2)** in a notepad. You will be using it in the next step.

1. Get back to **Visual Studio Code**.

1. Right-click on **.env.sample (1)** and select **Rename (2)**.

    ![](../media/af29.png)
