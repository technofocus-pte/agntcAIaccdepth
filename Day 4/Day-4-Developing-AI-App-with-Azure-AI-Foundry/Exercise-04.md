# Exercise 4: Fine-Tuning Prompts for Optimal Performance

**Note:** Due to high demand, AML Compute quota may be unavailable for some users, which may prevent execution of certain lab steps in this exercise. However, this will **not impact your lab progress**. You can read through the steps, understand the exercise, and then run the updated validation—progress will still be recorded. Thank you for your understanding.

## Lab Overview
In this hands-on lab, you will explore fine-tuning prompts for optimal performance, learning how to craft precise and effective input queries that maximize the accuracy, relevance, and efficiency of AI-generated responses. You will experiment with structuring prompts to guide AI behavior, incorporating context, constraints, and desired output formats to achieve more consistent results. By iterating on prompt design and analyzing AI responses, you will develop best practices for refining inputs to suit various use cases, from summarization and data extraction to creative writing and technical problem-solving.

## Lab Objectives
In this lab, you will perform the following:
- Task 1: Perform Iterative Prompt Tuning and Variant Comparison
- Task 2: Optimize Flow Performance for Production

## Task 1: Perform Iterative Prompt Tuning and Variant Comparison 
It refines model responses by adjusting prompts in successive iterations. This process allows for systematic evaluation of the differences between output variants, ensuring that the model's performance improves with each iteration and produces the most accurate and relevant responses.

   Text: The history of the internet dates back to the early 1960s, when the idea of a global network of computers was first proposed. In the late 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects 
   Agency Network (ARPANET) was developed by the United States Department of Defense. It was the first operational packet-switching network and the precursor to the modern internet. The 
   1970s and 1980s saw the development of various protocols and standards, such as TCP/IP, which allowed different networks to communicate with each other. In the 1990s, the invention 
   of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee revolutionized the internet, making it accessible to the general public. Since then, the internet has grown exponentially, becoming an 
   integral part of daily life for billions of people around the world.

   Text: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. AI has various applications in today's society, 
   including robotics, natural language processing, and decision-making systems. AI can be categorized into narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and general AI, which can 
   perform any intellectual task that a human can. Despite its benefits, AI also poses ethical concerns, such as privacy invasion and job displacement.
