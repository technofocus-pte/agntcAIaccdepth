###
# The data model used for this sample is based on the hotel data model from the Azure AI Search samples.
# When deploying a new index in Azure AI Search using the import wizard you can choose to deploy the 'hotel-samples'
# dataset, see here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-get-started-portal.
# This is the dataset used in this sample with some modifications.
# This model adds vectors for the 2 descriptions in English and French.
# Both are based on the 1536 dimensions of the OpenAI models.
# You can adjust this at creation time and then make the change below as well.
