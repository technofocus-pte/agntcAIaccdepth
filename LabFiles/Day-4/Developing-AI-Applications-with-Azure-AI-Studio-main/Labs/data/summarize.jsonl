{"text": "The history of the internet dates back to the early 1960s, when the idea of a global network of computers was first proposed. In the late 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was developed by the United States Department of Defense. It was the first operational packet-switching network and the precursor to the modern internet. The 1970s and 1980s saw the development of various protocols and standards, such as TCP/IP, which allowed different networks to communicate with each other. In the 1990s, the invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee revolutionized the internet, making it accessible to the general public. Since then, the internet has grown exponentially, becoming an integral part of daily life for billions of people around the world.", "summary": "The internet's history began in the 1960s with ARPANET, developed by the U.S. Department of Defense.

{"text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the replication of human intelligence in machines that can learn and think. It has various applications in society, including robotics, natural language processing, and decision-making systems. AI can be classified into narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and general AI, which can perform any intellectual task that a human can. However, AI also raises ethical concerns, such as privacy invasion and job displacement.", "summary": "AI replicates human intelligence in machines, with applications in robotics, language processing, and decision-making. It includes narrow AI for specific tasks and general AI for broader functions. Ethical concerns involve privacy and job displacement."}
{"text": "Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, have accelerated the process. This has led to more frequent extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and other environmental impacts. Addressing climate change requires global cooperation and significant changes in energy consumption and environmental policies.", "summary": "Climate change involves significant shifts in global temperatures and weather, accelerated by human activities such as fossil fuel combustion. This results in extreme weather and rising sea levels. Tackling climate change demands global cooperation and changes in energy use and policies."}
