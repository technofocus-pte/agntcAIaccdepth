# Exercise 1: Setup AI Project and perform Chat Completion from VS Code
## Estimated duration : 120 minutes
## Lab scenario

In this hands-on lab, you will set up the necessary environment for building AI Agents. You will begin by configuring an AI Project in Azure AI Foundry, followed by deploying a Large Language Model (LLM) and embedding models. Next, you will establish connectivity from Visual Studio Code to the AI Project. Finally, you will perform a simple chat completion call to validate the setup.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

- Task 1: Setting up the AI Project in the Azure AI Foundry
- Task 2: Deploying an LLM and embedding models
- Task 3: Install dependencies, create a virtual environment, and create an environment variables file

## Task 1: Setting up the AI Project in the Azure AI Foundry

In this task, you will create and configure an AI Project within Azure AI Foundry. This involves setting up the necessary resources, defining project parameters, and ensuring that the environment is ready for deploying AI models. By the end of this task, you will have a fully initialized AI Project, serving as the foundation for further development and experimentation.

      ```

    ![](./media/ag50.png)   

1. Later Open the **Lab 1 - Project Setup.ipynb** file. The **Lab 1 - Project Setup.ipynb** notebook guides you through setting up an AI Project in Azure AI Foundry, deploying an LLM and embedding models, and configuring VS Code connectivity. It also includes a simple Chat Completion API call to verify the setup. Running this notebook ensures that your environment is correctly configured for developing AI-powered applications. 

    ![](./media/ag61.png)

1. Select the **Select kernel (1)** setting available in the top right corner and select **Install/enable selected extensions (python+jupyter) (2)**.

    ![](./media/lab1-22.png)

1. Select **Python Environments** to ensure that Jupyter Notebook runs in the correct Python interpreter with the necessary dependencies installed. 

    ![](./media/lab1-23.png)

1. Select **venv (Python 3.x.x)** from the list as this version is likely required for compatibility with Azure AI Foundry SDK and other dependencies.

    ![](./media/lab1-24.png)

      > **Note:** If **venv (Python 3.x.x)** does not appear in the list. Close and Open the Visual studio code. 

1. Run the first cell to import necessary Python libraries for working with Azure AI services.   

    ![](./media/ag72.png)

1. Run the below cell to retrieve the project connection string and model name from environment variables. These values are needed to interact with the Large Language Model (LLM) securely, without hardcoding sensitive information.

    ![](./media/ag73.png)

1. Run the below cell to connect to your Azure AI Foundry project using the connection string. This establishes a secure connection with AIProjectClient, enabling interactions with your project resources.

    ![](./media/ag74.png)

1. Run the below cell to interact with the GPT-4o model using your Azure AI Foundry project. This code initializes a chat client, sends a request for a joke about a teddy bear, and prints the response. Finally see the output provided from the chat model.
