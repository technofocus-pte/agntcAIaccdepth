# Exercise 2: Build a Simple AI Agent

## Estimated time: 30 minutes
## Lab scenario
AI Agents are designed to automate tasks and generate insights based on user input. In this lab, you will learn how to build a simple AI Agent that processes data and generates a bar chart comparing different health benefit plans. This AI Agent leverages Azure AI services to analyze and visualize data efficiently.

## Lab Objective
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create a Simple AI Agent

## Task 1: Create a Simple AI Agent

In this task, you will build a simple AI Agent that processes data and generates a bar chart comparing different health benefit plans using Azure AI services for analysis and visualization.

1. Open the **Lab 2 - Create A Simple AI Agent.ipynb** file. This **Lab 2 - Create A Simple AI Agent.ipynb** notebook guides you through how to build a simple AI Agent that processes data and generates a bar chart comparing different health benefit plans.

1. Run this cell to create a **simple AI Agent** that processes data and generates a bar chart comparing different health benefit plans using Azure AI Foundry.This script initializes the AI agent, sends a prompt containing health plan data, and requests a bar chart. The agent processes the request, generates the chart, saves the image file, and then cleans up by deleting the agent.
